**GUI Basics:** 

`Our application starts on the customer UI, however the employee login button brings up the login screen. Depending on the ID the user is either prompted to the manager or the server side. From each of the respected sides the user should be able to do the functions outlined. On the login screen there are also buttons to directly access the manager and cutomer interface.`

**Steps for Compiling and Running GUI:** 

`Our application has a server and client interaction, to run the application locally need to split and link two terminals.`

**SERVER** \
`In the outermost directory calling "npm start" will start the server, where the server will began listening.` <br>
**CLIENT** \
`First need to cd into the client directory, once inside running "npm" start will load and launch the application.` 
  
This will run a GUI for a Point of Sales System for Rev's American Grill as part of a project in CSCE 315. 

**Steps for login:** \
In order to get to the server and manager side, an ID will need to be provided. For the manager, the ID is 100. For the server, the ID is 101.
